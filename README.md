# Full-stack-web-specialization---Hybrid-Mobile-App-Development
Hibrid mobile app dev with Cordova and Ionic framework


Welcome to Multiplatform Mobile App Development with Web Technologies course. This course is the fourth in the series of courses that form part of the Full-Stack Web Development Specialization. This course focuses on developing multiplatform mobile applications using the Web skills (HTML5, CSS and Javascript) that you have already acquired so far in the previous courses of this specialization. In particular we make use of the Cordova hybrid application framework and the Ionic framework, one of fastest growing mobile application frameworks, that is built with mobile-optimized HTML5 and CSS based components and AngularJS. You will learn about UI development with Ionic and then using Cordova's modules to access the native mobile platform's capabilities from Javascript.

At the end of this course, you will be able to:

Build mobile applications targeting multiple platforms with a single codebase
Leverage your HTML5, CSS, Javascript and AngularJS skills
Use various features of the Ionic framework to build hybrid mobile applications
Use Cordova plugins and ngCordova wrappers to access the mobile device's native capabilities.


This course includes four modules, each corresponding to one calendar week of work. A module is structured into a set of lessons.
